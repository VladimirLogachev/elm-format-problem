# elm-format-problem

This repo illustrates elm formatting issues.

When the repo is opened as a workspace, formatting doesn't work properly.

It only works for one of the apps, randomly `app1` or `app2`.

Extension output:

```
[Error - 12:17:09 AM] Error: No Elm workspace contains /Users/user/projects/elm-format-problem/app2/src/Main.elm delayed processing of request
```
